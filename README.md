# JavaBankingSimulation
This is a banking system using java saving the data as serializable object instead of using a database.

This project was done to flex my muscle with object serialization in java. An interestin functionality in this small project of a hard coded strong password checker that I implemented using and array of known password and it rejects passwords with users information such as name and gov ID combination.
Passwords are not encrypted and I print them so that I remember whenever I am testing the code.
